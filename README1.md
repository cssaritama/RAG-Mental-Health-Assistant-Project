# 🧠 RAG Mental Health Assistant

A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application that provides reliable and explainable answers to mental health–related queries by combining a **knowledge base of curated medical documents (WHO, NIH, CDC)** with a **Large Language Model (LLM)**.  

The project was developed as the **final project for the LLM Zoomcamp (DataTalksClub)** and follows all the official evaluation criteria for certification.

## 📌 Problem Description

Mental health information is often scattered across websites, research papers, and clinical guidelines. Patients, families, and even professionals may face challenges in:

- Finding **reliable sources quickly**  
- Avoiding **misinformation or unverified forums**  
- Getting **contextualized answers** instead of raw documents  

Our solution:  
A **RAG-based assistant** that allows users to ask questions in natural language and get **trustworthy, context-backed, and explainable answers** in real-time.  

✔ Combines **retrieval from curated sources** with **LLM reasoning**  
✔ Highlights **source documents** for transparency  
✔ Provides a **Streamlit-based interface** for easy interaction

## 🚀 Quickstart (Reproducibility)

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rag-mental-health-assistant.git
cd rag-mental-health-assistant
```

### 2. Set up environment
Create a `.env` file:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 3. Run everything in one command
```bash
bash run_all.sh
```

This will:  
✔ Install dependencies  
✔ Ingest the dataset into FAISS  
✔ Launch the Streamlit app  

### 4. Open the app
Go to: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

## 🧪 Evaluation

### Retrieval Evaluation
We evaluate **vector search**, **keyword search**, and **hybrid search** using:  
- Precision@k  
- Recall@k  
- MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)  

Hybrid consistently outperformed the others.

### LLM Evaluation
Multiple prompt variants were tested.  
Final version optimized for clarity, source citation, and user-friendly tone.  

---

## 📊 Monitoring Dashboard

The monitoring dashboard includes:

1. **Query distribution by type**  
2. **Response time histogram**  
3. **Relevance scores distribution**  
4. **User feedback (positive vs. negative)**  
5. **Usage trends over time**  

Users can also leave **feedback on answers**, stored in `data/feedback.csv`.

---

## 🐳 Containerization

- Run with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

- Services:  
  - `app` → Streamlit UI  
  - `retrieval` → Vector DB (FAISS)  
  - `monitoring` → Dashboard  

---

## 🔄 CI/CD

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) automatically:  
- Runs linting (flake8, black)  
- Executes unit tests  
- Runs evaluation scripts  
- Validates Docker build
